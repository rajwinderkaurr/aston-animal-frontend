# Replicating the project

To replicate the repo, follow the given steps:

## Clone the Repo

To clone the repo, use
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajwinderkaurr/aston-animal-frontend.git
```
## Setup Environment

Change to the directory:
```
cd aston-animal-backend
```

## Starting the server

To run the backend server, type in the terminal
```bash
npm start
```

## Testing the backend

To test if the backend is correctly working, first run the app. Then a message in the terminal window saying 
```Server started at port <PORT>```
will appear. Note the port number, and type in the browser window:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>/
```
If you get a JSON file presenting:
```
{ "messages": "Congrats! Server started. Use the front end to query..." }
```

# That's it!

We've successfully started the NodeJS server. Now, we only have to get the frontend from my repositories, and configure it to run with the backend
